<h1>How to play</h1>

<p>Every account gets to start one game for free. After that, a subscription is required.</p>

<p>To start a game, you must specify the "size" of the game: how many players per team, and how many systems in the galaxy? And how long each "turn" will be.</p>
<p>You'll then need to input the emails of the friends you want to play with. They'll recieve an invitation link once you click "Invite" at the bottom of the page, so it's probably best to make sure they actually want to play before you invite.</p>
<p>The game will be in a "waiting" state until all of your friends accept the invitation by clicking the link. If you decide they're taking too long, or you stop being friends with one of them, you can cancel the game at any time, and they'll be notified that the game was cancelled.</p>

<p>Once all your friends have joined the game, you'll get to assign the teams however you wish, since you started the game. But that is the last of your special priveleges. From now on you're just a player.</p>

<p>Next, players vote to choose their team's Admiral. If there's a tie, the game picks for you. Everyone gets one vote, and you can't change your mind. Once everyone has voted, or the predefined time limit has passed, the Admiral will be assigned for each team, and will remain the Admiral for the rest of the game.</p>
<p>The Admiral now has to choose the orders and resources to give to each of his Captains. Both Admirals have up to 1 "turn" to decide on their orders, but the game starts as soon as both Admirals have submitted their decisions.</p>
<p>As a Captain, once your Admiral submits his orders, you will see what resources you have and what system you're fighting in. Now you get to decide how to spend your resources and how to layout your troops when they drop in-system. The game has started, so turns can pass you by if you take too long, and your ships wont appear in system until you set them up. Don't wait too long!</p>
<p>Once in system, your job is simple: fulfill the orders the Admiral sent you.</p>

<p>Select a unit to give them orders. Each unit has different options available. Nothing will change until the turn-time elapses, and the server recomputes the world. You'll see the results of your orders then, and get the chance to adjust your tactics.</p>
